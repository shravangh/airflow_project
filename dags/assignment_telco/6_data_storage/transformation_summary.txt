Summary of Transformation Logic Applied:

1. AvgChargesPerMonth:
   - Computed as TotalCharges / tenure (avoiding division by zero).
   - Represents the average charges per customer per month.

2. ExtraCharges:
   - Difference between TotalCharges and (MonthlyCharges * tenure).
   - Captures any extra/unexpected charges compared to expected billing.

3. LifetimeValue:
   - tenure * MonthlyCharges.
   - A proxy for the customer's total lifetime value to the company.

4. Tenure_Charges_Interaction:
   - tenure * (MonthlyCharges / 100).
   - Captures the interaction between tenure and monthly charges, scaled down.

5. All engineered features are rounded to 2 decimal places.

The transformed dataset is then stored in SQLite database:
- Database file: customer_db.sqlite
- Table name: processed_data
